Paul will be showing you how he works with VueJs and Nuxt and their associated ecosystem of
libraries and tools on a daily basis to make developing in VueJs awesome.

#### What we managed to get through on the night

-   Give structure to your Vue projects with Nuxt 2
-   Use Vuetify to speed up UI development
-   Wrap other people's components to add new behaviours or update layout
-   Hook our custom components into Vuetify's form validation
-   Use Nuxt 2 and VueJs to easily add new features to an existing app with an Express backend, even if itâ€™s not based on VueJs
